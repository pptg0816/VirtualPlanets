# VirtualPlanets
EE552ws Final

# introduction
The goal of our project is to achieve a 3D demonstration program that can simulate the rotation of the solar system and internal planets. 
We have achieved this goal and allow users to use mouse drag and wheel zoom to change their viewpoint position and viewpoint distance. 
On this basis, we have also added two buttons, and when users click them, 
they can realize "start / pause planetary rotation" and "accelerate / restore rotation speed".
At the same time, we also set the appropriate size and correct texture for each planet, and added stars in background.

# Environment
Our project is based on Processing Java version and requires PeasyCam Library.

# Change the view point and scope
You could change the view point by keeping the mouse left button pressed and drag it. 
Furthermore, you could use the zoom wheel to zoom your view scope.

# Use the function button
Once you find a view point and scope you prefer (Of course, you could also change it anytime even after you start the rotation), 
click the “play” button and the rotation may start.

You may find the message on the “play” button has been changed as “pause”, at this time, if you click it again, the rotation may stop.

Only when the planets are rotating would the “Fast/Slow” button work. So, you could try to click it after you start the rotation.

When the message is “Fast”, it means the present rotation speed in Slow mode, you could set it as Fast mode after clicking it.

When the message is “Slow”, it means the present rotation speed in Fast mode, you could set it as Slow mode after clicking it.
